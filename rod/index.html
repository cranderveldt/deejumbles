    <h3 class="h3">What is it?</h3>

    <p>4 person (2 teams) relay races of the Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth. As of now, this is not a tourney format, just for-fun exhibition races. There’s no set schedule, but the goal is to not disrupt any actual tournaments that are occurring. Race time commitment is ~2 hours maximum. The format and rules of the relay will very likely change from one relay to the next (e.g. different characters, different mods, maybe some custom challenges). Please don't hesitate to send me any feedback or ideas.</p>
    
    <h3 class="h4">Next TBD</h3>
    <!-- <p>Saturday, June 11. Event will start at <strong>1430 EDT</strong> with Relay #4. Relay #5 will follow, probably starting around <strong>1600 EDT</strong> - Cain, Isaac to BB and Maga Satan (key provided), Lost, Judas (<a href="http://bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/Seeds" target="_blank">with D0NTST0P seed</a>). All runs are normal mode, Jud6s mod, BLCKCNDL easter egg.</p>

    <p>Please note: The D0NTST0P seed <strong>is a nontrivial change to the play style of the game</strong> which changes the value and utility of many items. It is quite difficult, and will require some practice, even from the highest skill level players.</p>

    <h4 class="h5">Time Limit Changes</h4>
    <p>There is no predetermined time limit for each leg. Time limits are determined by whichever team finishes each leg first. The trailing team gets the length of time the leading team took to finish the leg in question, plus five minutes, to finish their corresponding leg.</p>

    <p>For example: Player A1 v Player B1. A1 finishes in 15m, B1 has until 15 + 5 = 20m to finish their run. Player A2 (started at 15m) finishes in 15m. Player B2 (started at 20m) has 15+5 =20m to finish their leg, so on the clock they must finish by 40m.</p> -->

    <h3 class="h3">How it works:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>I will suggest a few times (including weeknights) and open sign ups.</li>
      <li>From the sign ups, I will form two teams, with the goal of balancing skill over the two teams. This event is open to players of a wide array of skill, but you must be able to consistently complete runs to be considered.</li> 
      <li>I will announce the 4 types of runs and the order those runs will be done in a few days in advance.</li>
      <li>Teams can decide for themselves who will take which leg. I needs to know this reasonably in advance (like an hour or so) before the race starts.</li> 
      <li>For funsies, I’d like the teams to decide on a team captain and a team name. Team captains will be asked to pop in to the commentators booth at certain times during the relay for some locker room style chat and shit talking.</li>
      <li>Racers must use a 1001% save file.</li>
      <li>I will be casting it.</li>
      <li>For “hand-offs”: Runs are complete when the chest hits the ground AND the racer says “done.” At that point, the next racer can begin immediately with their resets.</li>
      <li>There is no predetermined time limit for each leg. Time limits are determined by whichever team finishes each leg first. The trailing team gets the length of time the leading team took to finish the leg in question, plus five minutes, to finish their corresponding leg.</li>
      <li>For example: Player A1 v Player B1. A1 finishes in 15m, B1 has until 15 + 5 = 20m to finish their run. Player A2 (started at 15m) finishes in 15m. Player B2 (started at 20m) has 15+5 =20m to finish their leg, so on the clock they must finish by 40m</li>
      <!-- <li>The first three individual legs each have a <strong>25m time limit</strong>. If that time elapses without a completed run, the next racer on the team can begin (the host/ref will let you know that you can start). The final leg has no time limit.</li> -->
      <li>I will be casting it, and Crander will co-host. I’m happy to bring a lot of people in to commentate throughout the event.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="h3">Rule details:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>If the player receives the “game over” screen after the elected boss is dead, their kill will not count. (Essentially, this means that you have you to survive until the room is completely empty of danger.)</li>
      <li>If the player dies after the boss is dead and spawns in the previous room, the player will have to re-enter the room before the next player can start their run.</li> 
      <li>Racers will be disqualified if they exit the game during their run. (No familiar re-ordering, floor resetting, etc.)</li>
      <li>Racers are allowed to use any glitches that do not involve exiting the game (such as the Black Market clip).</li>
      <li>No co-op babies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="h3">Casting requests:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Please no overlays (just the game)</li>
      <li>Please have the latest item tracker</li> 
      <li>Please use a set resolution - 1600x900, 1066x600, or 533x300 - to make capping easier. You can change these in your options.ini file.</li>
      <li>Please don’t stream over 1000 bitrate. My computer should be fine but let’s not test it.</li>
    </ul>
